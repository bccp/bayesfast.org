# Fast Bayesian analysis with efficiency.

BayesFast is a Python package for efficient Bayesian analysis developed by He Jia and Uros Seljak, which can be orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods, on both posterior sampling and evidence estimation.

For cosmologists, we have an add-on package CosmoFast, which provides several frequently-used cosmological modules.

Both packages are in live development, so the API may be changed at any time. Note that some parts of the code are still experimental, as we haven't implemented public API for them. If you find a bug or have useful suggestions, please feel free to open an issue / pull request, or email He Jia. We also have a roadmap for features to implement in the future. Your contributions would be greatly appreciated!
